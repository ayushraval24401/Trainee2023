<!DOCTYPE html> : All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration.
                The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the
                browser about what document type to expect.
                And also instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

<html lang="en"> : The HTML lang attribute specifies the language of the text content used on a web page.
                    example: here we have used "en" which means web page contains english language.
                    different lang are "es" for Spanish, "fr" for French etc.

<head> : This is html tag. it is used to define the head portion of the document which contains 
            information related to the document. The <head> tag contains other head elements such as 
            <title>, <meta>, <link>, <style> <link> etc.

<meta> : HTML <meta> tag is used to represent the metadata about the HTML document which means data about data. 
            It specifies page description, keywords, copyright, language, author of the documents, etc.
             it is used by search engines, browsers and other web services which scan 
             the site or webpage to know about the webpage.

<meta charset="UTF-8"> : The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. 
            The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, 
            which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!

<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> : The X-UA-Compatible meta tag allows web authors
                            to choose what version of Internet Explorer the page should be rendered as. 
                            
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> : 
        The viewport meta tag tells the browser that the width of the screen should be considered the "Full Width"
         of the page. Meaning no matter the width of the device you are on, whether on desktop or mobile. 
        the website will follow the width of the device the user is on.

<title> : allows you to give a web page a title.

<body> :  defines the document's body
