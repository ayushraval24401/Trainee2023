Task:- Extra

<!DOCTYPE html>: Doctype HTML is a declaration that tells the browser what version of HTML the document 
is written in. This declaration appears as the very first line in an HTML file.

<html lang="en">:
The lang attribute specifies the language of the element's content.
Common examples are "en" for English, "es" for Spanish, "fr" for French and so on

<meta charset="UTF-8">:
The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. 
The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, 
which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">:
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. 
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device 
(which will vary depending on the device)

<meta http-equiv X-UA-compatible content IE Edge>:
The X-UA-Compatible meta tag is a http-equiv meta tag. 
X-UA-Compatible Meta Tag Recommended Uses: Use the X-UA-Compatible meta tag on web pages where you 
suspect that Internet Explorer 8 will attempt to render the page in an incorrect view.
 Such as when you have an XHTML document with an XML declaration

<tt> tage:-Not supported in HTML5. Use CSS instead.

The <tt> HTML element creates inline text which is presented using the user agent's default monospace font face.
 This element was created for the purpose of rendering text as it would be displayed 
on a fixed-width display such as a teletype, text-only screen, or line printer.

Ex:-<p>
  Enter the following at the telnet command prompt: <code>set localecho</code><br />

  The telnet client should display: <tt>Local Echo is on</tt>
</p>

output:-
Enter the following at the telnet command prompt: set localecho
The telnet client should display: Local Echo is on
